# SC-Sol-Dataset
The defect data set of Solidity smart contracts : COOP and SC-Sol.
---
## Metrics
* COOP
* SC-Sol
## Labels
* The number of contract defects
* The number of each type of vulnerability corresponding to the contract
## Tools
* Solidity AST Tool
[solidity-parser-antlr](https://github.com/federicobond/solidity-parser-antlr)

* Python3.8

## Source code
[Xblock](http://xblock.pro/ethereum/), where the file name represents the smart contract address of Ethereum.
## Defect data
The defect data comes from [Blockchain Smart Contract Security Checking System](http://www.sjtubsrc.net/index.html). By inputting the address of the smart contract, the feedback result of the platform is obtained, and the label is obtained after data processing.
